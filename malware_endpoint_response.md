# Incident Response Playbook – Malware-Infected Endpoint  
**Organisation:** Tata  
**Incident Type:** Malware on Linux Endpoint  
**Framework Reference:** NIST SP 800-61 – Computer Security Incident Handling Guide

---

## 1. Purpose
Define standard response procedures for detecting, containing, and eradicating malware on a Linux-based endpoint within Tata, ensuring minimal operational disruption.

---

## 2. Trigger (Detection Events)
- CrowdStrike Falcon detects malware behaviour (e.g. privilege escalation, process injection)
- SIEM alert from Splunk showing suspicious binaries executing on a Linux host
- User reports unusual system behaviour (lag, pop-ups, outbound traffic)

---

## 3. Initial Triage and Analysis
| Action                                           | Owner               |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Validate alert, collect host details/IP          | SOC Analyst          |
| Identify malware type (RAT, ransomware, etc.)     | Malware Analyst      |
| Review hash & upload to VirusTotal               | Threat Intel Team    |
| Identify if lateral movement is occurring        | Incident Handler     |

---

## 4. Containment
- Isolate endpoint using CrowdStrike *network containment* feature
- Disable user’s access to sensitive systems
- Block command-and-control (C2) IPs/domains on firewall
- Capture volatile data before system shutdown (if forensics needed)

---

## 5. Eradication
- Remove malicious binaries & services from Linux machine
- Apply threat-specific remediation script via SSH or orchestration tools
- Update antivirus database / definitions
- Patch exploited vulnerability (if root cause identified)

---

## 6. Recovery
- Reimage/rebuild the Linux system if necessary
- Restore data from verified clean backups
- Unisolate host and return to production network
- Monitor system for 48-72 hours post-recovery

---

## 7. Post-Incident Activities
- Root-cause analysis (CVE exploited? user action? software bug?)
- Update IPS/EDR rules and YARA signatures
- Internal reporting to Tata IT Security Team + Lessons Learned Log
- Communicate awareness to prevent repeat infection

---

## 8. Escalation Matrix

| Level  | Escalation Point             | Contact Method      |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Tier 1 | SOC Analyst                 | SIEM / Email        |
| Tier 2 | Tata IT Security Team       | Hotline / Ticket    |
| Tier 3 | Security Operations Manager | Phone               |
| Tier 4 | CISO                        | Executive Brief     |

---

## 9. Tools / Platforms Used
- CrowdStrike Falcon (EDR)
- Splunk SIEM
- VirusTotal (Malware Hash Lookup)
- SSH (for manual remediation)
- Ticketing system (ServiceNow / Jira)
