# ðŸ“„ Incident Response Playbooks

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains a growing library of **Incident Response (IR) Playbooks**.  
Each playbook is designed to guide security teams through specific attack scenarios, aligned with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** phases: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.  

The goal is to provide **practical, easy-to-follow workflows** for responding to different types of incidents.
