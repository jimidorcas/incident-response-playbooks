# ðŸ”’ Incident Response Playbook â€“ Ransomware Attack

## ðŸ“Œ Scenario
An employee opens a malicious email attachment that executes ransomware on their workstation.  
The ransomware encrypts files locally and begins propagating across shared drives, displaying a ransom note demanding payment in cryptocurrency.

## ðŸ”Ž NIST CSF Phases

### 1. Identify
- Alerts from antivirus/EDR tools indicating unusual file encryption.  
- Multiple users reporting locked files or ransom notes.  
- Unusual spikes in file system activity (high CPU, mass file renames).  
- Review of SIEM logs for indicators of compromise (IOCs).  

---

### 2. Protect
- Ensure regular backups are performed and stored offline.  
- Restrict administrative privileges to limit ransomware spread.  
- Apply email filtering to block suspicious attachments.  
- Train employees to identify and report suspicious emails.  

---

### 3. Detect
- SIEM alerts for mass file changes or suspicious PowerShell commands.  
- Antivirus/EDR detection of ransomware binaries.  
- Monitoring logs for suspicious extensions (.locked, .crypt, etc.).  
- Detection of communication attempts to known ransomware C2 servers.  

---

### 4. Respond
- Immediately isolate infected endpoints from the network (disconnect Ethernet/Wi-Fi).  
- Disable file sharing on impacted systems.  
- Preserve forensic evidence:  
  - Collect affected logs, memory dumps, and encrypted file samples.  
- Reset affected user credentials.  
- Notify management, legal, and compliance teams.  
- If financial/PII data is involved, prepare regulatory notifications (GDPR, ICO, etc.).  

---

### 5. Recover
- Restore files from clean, verified backups.  
- Monitor restored systems for reinfection attempts.  
- Apply security patches to exploited vulnerabilities.  
- Conduct post-incident review with lessons learned.  
- Update policies and training to reduce recurrence.  

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- Ransomware spreads quickly â†’ speed of **detection and isolation** is critical.  
- Backups are the strongest line of recovery.  
- Incident recovery must include both technical fixes and **business communication**.  
- Lessons learned should update awareness training and technical controls.
